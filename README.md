# Pathfinding

### Introduction

1) Lay out first two white blocks as the starting node and the ending node
2) Layout the red nodes as obstacles
3) Execute Search Algorithm <br />
  press **A** for A* Search <br />
  press **G** for Greedy Search <br />
  press **U** for Uniform Cost search <br />
4) press **R** to reset grid
